          <h1 id="title">Frida Kahlo</h1>
          <p>"The twenty-first-century Frida is both a star – a commercial property complete with fan clubs and merchandising – and an embodiment of the hopes and aspirations of a near-religious group of followers. 
            This wild, hybrid Frida, a mixture of tragic bohemian, Virgin of Guadalupe, revolutionary heroine and Salma Hayek, has taken such great hold on the public imagination that it tends to obscure the historically retrievable Kahlo."

              <li><strong>1907</strong> - Born in Coyoacán, Mexico City, Mexico</li>
              <li><strong>1922</strong> - Kahlo enrolled at the renowned National Preparatory School. 
                At this school she first met the famous Mexican muralist Diego Rivera for the first time.

              <li><strong>1925</strong> - Kahlo and Alejandro Gómez Arias were traveling together on a 
                bus when the vehicle collided with a streetcar. As a result of the collision, Kahlo was impaled by

                injuries as a result, including fractures in her spine and pelvis. After a bus accident Kahlo unable to walk for three months, 
                Kahlo began to paint in order to pass the time. She started to consider a career as a medical illustrator, as well, which would 
                combine her interests in science and art. </li>
              <li><strong>1928</strong> - Kahlo reconnected with Rivera. She asked him to evaluate her work and he encouraged her. The two

                Museum of Modern Art and later moved to Detroit for Rivera’s commission with the Detroit Institute of Arts. The six months spent in San Francisco were a productive period for Kahlo,
                 who further developed the folk art style she had adopted in Cuernavaca.</li>
              <li><strong>1933</strong> - Kahlo was living in New York City with her husband Diego Rivera. Rivera was commissioned by Nelson Rockefeller 
                to create a mural named as Man at the Crossroads at Rockefeller Center. Rivera tried to include Vladimir Lenin in the painting, who is a communist leader. Rockefeller stopped his work and that part was painted over.

          <p class="end">Frida Kahlo one of the most significant artists of the twentieth century and one of Mexico's most important twentieth-century figures, who’s reputation as an artist developed late in her life and grew even further posthumously.
            <br>
            She gradually gained more recognition in the late 1970s when feminist scholars began to question the exclusion of female and non-Western artists from the art historical canon and the Chicano Movement lifted her as one of their icons.</p>
